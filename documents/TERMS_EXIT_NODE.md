**FULL VERSION:**

1\. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS

These terms and conditions (the “Terms”) is a binding legal agreement between you and NetSys Inc. (“Mysterium Networks” or “we”) that governs your use of the Mysterium network (the “Network”).

Your use of the Network is subject to these Terms. By using the Network you are fully accepting the terms, conditions and disclaimers contained in this document and all policies and guidelines that are incorporated by reference. If you do not accept these terms and conditions you must immediately stop using the Network. You shall not use the Network in contradiction with these Terms or any applicable law or regulation of the country or territory you originate from or reside in or any applicable jurisdiction (the “Applicable Law”). For the purposes of these Terms, the term “using the Network” means accessing, connecting to or utilizing the Network in any other way.

You may use the Network (a) if you have not reached the age of majority in your territory of residence (in most cases, 18 to 21) or if you do not have the ability to form binding contracts under the Applicable law or (b) if you are not the owner of the device on which you use the Network. 

2\. CHANGED TERMS

We shall have the right at any time to change or modify the Terms or any part thereof, or to impose new conditions, including, but not limited to, adding fees and charges for use. Such changes, modifications, additions or deletions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof, which may be given by means including, but not limited to, posting on our website, or by electronic or conventional mail, or by any other means by which you obtain notice thereof. Any use of the Network after such notice shall be deemed to constitute acceptance of such changes, modifications or additions. 

3\. YOUR ROLE

The Network allows users (the “Users”) to enhance their security and increase privacy while using the internet. It is accomplished by creating virtual tunnels through one or more connections to other users of the Network (the “Nodes”) and by using their equipment and resources to route the Users to their final destinations. 

By using the Network, you agree to act as a Node operator and become a part of the Network. These Terms govern your use of the Network as a Node. Therefore, you consent that the Users and we use your hardware, communication and other resources. 

4\. COMPENSATION

You may get compensation for being a Node in the Network from us under the following conditions https://mystnodes.com/payout-rules.

5\. EQUIPMENT

You shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining all necessary hardware, software and other equipment and resources needed to use the Network and all charges related thereto. 

As an option, you can use Mysterium software ([https://github.com/mysteriumnetwork](https://github.com/mysteriumnetwork)) to use the Network.

6\. OUR ROLE
 
We do not encourage, support and contribute to illegal activities and we are resolved to keep the Network operating legally and to protect you. To this end, we enter into binding agreements with the Users by which they undertake to use the Network only for legal purposes; however, we have no technical possibility to monitor and control their activities on the Network and cannot guarantee that the Users will comply.

Although we strongly believe that you should not be liable for the traffic which passes through your Node, you accept, agree and fully understand that we cannot guarantee that no illegal or criminal traffic passes in or through the Network and that you will never face any legal liability. In the case you will obtain any inquiries from legal authorities about your use of the Network or face an official investigation related to the use of your resources by the User using the Network, we are free to take a decision to provide you with any help and assistance, including legal advice, that we might find necessary or suitable in the specific situation.

**PRIVACY POLICY & NO-LOGS PLEDGE**

Effective date: January 18, 2022

Netsys Inc. ("us", "we", or "our") operates the Mysterium network (the “Network”).

This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of data when you use the Network and the choices you have associated with that data. This Privacy Policy applies only if and to the extent we process the data in relation to the Network. 

This Privacy Policy supplements our [Terms of Use](#TERMS-OF-USE) (“ToU”) and is an integral part of it. If any provisions of the Privacy Policy and the ToU cannot be read in any manner other than a one that produces an irreconcilable conflict between them, the provisions of this Privacy Policy shall prevail. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, the terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our ToU.

A. NO-LOGS PLEDGE   

We will not collect any information or store any logs about your browsing activity (including queries, data destinations, IP addresses or timestamps). We are based in a jurisdiction (Panama) which laws do not require us to retain any of such data. The only information we collect in connection to your use of the Network is the information listed in this Privacy Policy below.

Additionally, as we provide the Network by creating virtual tunnels through one or more connections to other users of the Network (i.e. the Nodes, as defined in the ToU) and by using their equipment and resources to route you to your destination, it is not technically possible for us monitor your activities in the Network.
In addition to our no-logs pledge this creates an additional layer of privacy for you.

Having said this we feel that it is our obligation to inform you that the Network cannot guarantee 100% privacy. We enter into binding legal agreements with our users who run the nodes in the Network to prevent them from logging and storing the traffic which passes their nodes, but we cannot promise they will not.

If the applicable law requires us to disclose your data, we will be forced to do so; however, as we collect and store just minimal data which does not allow to identify you (see below), the impact of such disclosure on your privacy will be minimal.

B. ANONYMOUS DATA

To use the Network you need to create a public / private key pair. Your public key will be passed to us to register you with the Network. Note, that this public key will not include any of your personal data and you cannot be identified by it.

When you use the Network we may collect minimal information on how the Network is used and whether the connection was successful. However, this information is anonymous and cannot identify you and we use it to develop and maintain the Network.

C. CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Such changes, modifications, additions or deletions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof, which may be given by means including, but not limited to, posting on our website, or by electronic or conventional mail, or by any other means by which you obtain notice thereof. Any use of the Network after such notice shall be deemed to constitute acceptance of such changes, modifications or additions.
